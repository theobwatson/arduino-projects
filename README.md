# Arduino Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Arduino projects portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of projects that I have created to explore the capabilities of Arduino.

## Projects

### 1. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

In this project, I used a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. The data is displayed on an LCD screen, giving real-time updates on the environment.

**Components:**

- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 sensor
- 10k ohm resistor
- LCD display
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### 2. LED Blinking Pattern

This project is about controlling LEDs in a sequence.

**Components:**

- Arduino Uno
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 220 ohm resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### 3. Servo Motor Control

Here, I used a potentiometer to control the position of a servo motor.

**Components:**

- Arduino Uno
- Servo motor
- Potentiometer
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### 4. Traffic Light System

This project simulates a traffic light system using red, yellow, and green LEDs.

**Components:**

- Arduino Uno
- Red, Yellow, Green LEDs
- 220 ohm resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Setup Instructions

To can compile the Arduino sketches, please follow these steps:

1. **Install the Arduino IDE:**
   Download and install the Arduino IDE from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Open the Arduino IDE and go to `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries...`. Search for and install the following libraries:

   - DHT sensor library
   - LiquidCrystal library
   - Servo library

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/theobwatson/arduino-projects.git
   ```
